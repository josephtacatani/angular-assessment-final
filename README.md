# AngularAssessment

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.4.

## Development server

Run `nvm use 18` to use node version 18.20.4
Navigate to `cd angular-assessment` to locate the folder
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Automatically this will run in port `http://localhost:3000/home`. This is because this was setup by me through client requirements.

## Use JSON-SERVER

Run `npm install json-server` to install json or start json-server
Run `npx json-server --route 4200 db.json` to run the json-server in port 4200 because this based from client requirements
